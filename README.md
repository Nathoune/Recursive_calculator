Simple calculator through recursion

Care to brackets for Priority + only one binary operator is managed at a time
-> 1+2+3 must be wrote (1+2)+3 or 1+(2+3)

Need Add :
- Error handler
- multiples operators followed without brackets and/or automatic bracket adding with priority checks
- Priority handler
- Other binary operators (only +,-,*,/)
- operateurs unaires / ternaires
